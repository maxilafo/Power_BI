**Dataset**
For this project, I used the [Contoso Sales Sample Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46801), from Microsoft.
I made few changes on the dataset:

 - *Altered the dates of sales, promotions, and calendar:* to match them in a more actual date
- *Added a table with sales targets* to develop a KPI dashboard

**Content:**  
This project includes 3 pages:

Sales: with global metrics and overview data  
KPI dashboard: for targets follow up. Also colors will change based on the target advance  
YoY: for comparisons with previous period
