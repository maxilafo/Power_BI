__The purpose of this project was to apply a wide range of Power BI techniques, as a practice.__

I used techniques such as:
* Conditional formatting by targets, both in visualizations and with DAX
* Advanced tooltips
* Navigation
* Bookmarks
* Drilltroughs
* VAR/RETURN functions in DAX
* Data Modeling

**Dataset**  
For this project, I used the [Contoso Sales Sample Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46801), from Microsoft.
I made few changes on the dataset:

 - *Altered the dates of sales, promotions, and calendar:* to match them in a more actual date
- *Added a table with sales targets* to develop a KPI dashboard

**Content:**  
This project includes 3 pages:

Sales: with global metrics and overview data  
KPI dashboard: for targets follow up. Also colors will change based on the target advance  
YoY: for comparisons with previous period
