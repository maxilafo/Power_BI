#About this project#

The goal of this project is to develop a __KPI dashboard with key metrics for top-level executive team__, so I kept it as simple as possible to ease the readability to answer the most overall important questions for high level executives, while taking care of a good design.

Executive team will look for overall performance metric, so no need of high detailed report is needed.

I covered for the 4 sections required by the project, the following questions:

__Sales:__

>What's the overall YTD Sales company?
>What is the sales progress compared to the previous year?
>What's the overall YTD Margin?
>How many orders were shipped?

__Products Performance:__

>Which one are the TOP 5 sales products?
>What's the sales of each product category?
>What's the % Margin sales of each product category?
>How many units were sold on each product category?
>
__Key Customers:__

>Which one are the TOP 5 Customers, and their sales?
>What percentage do they represent of total sales?

__Shipping Costs:__

>What's the average freight cost?
>What's the total cost of shipping?
>What's the % cost of shipping? And the trend?
>Disclosure by Shipper Company
