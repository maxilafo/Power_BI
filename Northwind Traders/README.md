__This project was part of the competition [Maven Northwind Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-northwind-challenge/24), which had almost 300 submissions, and while this project was not the winner, I received a honorable mention.__
>_"Maximiliano Lafosse showcased some really solid design skills and kept the focus on just a handful of relevant metrics for the executives"_

The goal of this project is to develop a __KPI dashboard with key metrics for top-level executive team__, so I kept it as simple as possible to ease the readability to answer the most overall important questions for high level executives, while taking care of a good design.

Executive team will look for overall performance metric, so no need of high detailed report is needed.

I covered for the 4 sections required by the project, the following questions:

Sales:

What's the overall YTD Sales company?
What is the sales progress compared to the previous year?
What's the overall YTD Margin?
How many orders were shipped?
Products Performance:

Which one are the TOP 5 sales products?
What's the sales of each product category?
What's the % Margin sales of each product category?
How many units were sold on each product category?
Key Customers:

Which one are the TOP 5 Customers, and their sales?
What percentage do they represent of total sales?
Shipping Costs:

What's the average freight cost?
What's the total cost of shipping?
What's the % cost of shipping? And the trend?
