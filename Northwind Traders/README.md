This project was part of the competition [Maven Northwind Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-northwind-challenge/24)

The goal of this project is to develop a KPI dashboard with key metrics for top-level executive team.

Executive team will look for overall performance metric, so no need of high detailed report is needed.
